# Preface

*This datapack complies with the open-source license [GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.txt "Link to license page").*

**This datapack provides developers with practical functions compatible with all Minecraft versions (except those unable to install datapacks).**

**However, since the datapack involves numerous commands, older versions may not support all functions. This document will not individually specify version compatibility for each function.**

**Install the resource pack to use localized content (v3.2+). Otherwise, the datapack language defaults to zh_cn.**

**The mod version of this datapack is distributed via Modrinth and is functionally identical to the datapack version but may not be the latest release. Use the datapack version whenever possible.**

**This datapack includes a `dfl:dfl_enable` function that sets all entities' score in its objective to 1, facilitating detection by dependent datapacks or mods.**

**Example:**

```mcfunction
# Execute upon datapack load:
scoreboard objectives add dfl_enable dummy
scoreboard players set @e dfl_enable 0
# If not loaded:
function dfl:dfl_enable
execute unless score @n dfl_enable matches 1
# If loaded:
function dfl:dfl_enable
execute if score @n dfl_enable matches 1
```

**Note: Some functions specify "prerequisite functions" in their usage. These must be executed once before the main function.**

**Functions with `{xx:"xx"}` are [macro functions](https://zh.minecraft.wiki/w/Java%E7%89%88%E5%87%BD%E6%95%B0#%E5%AE%8F). Pass parameters via `{<param_name>:"<content>"}` (default parameters in usage are tested/recommended values). Parameter names (e.g., `num`) appear as `{num}` in descriptions. Format follows examples unless specified otherwise.**
